### Hour 6-8: Model Selection and Setup

**Objective:** Choose a suitable object detection model and set it up for training.

**Steps:**

1. **Model Selection:**
   - **Recommended Models:** YOLOv5 or YOLOv8 for their balance of speed and accuracy.

   - Ensure annotations are in the format required by YOLOv5 (TXT files with class and bounding box coordinates).

2. **Data Splitting:**
   - Split the dataset into training and validation sets (e.g., 80/20 split).

3. **Augmentation:**
   - Apply data augmentation techniques to improve generalization.
     - Horizontal/Vertical flips
     - Random scaling and cropping
     - Color jittering
   - YOLOv5 has built-in augmentation; ensure it’s enabled in the config.

   - Extract frames from videos if the dataset is in video format.
     ```python
     import cv2
     cap = cv2.VideoCapture('path_to_video.mp4')
     count = 0
     while cap.isOpened():
         ret, frame = cap.read()
         if not ret:
             break
         cv2.imwrite(f'frames/frame_{count}.jpg', frame)
         count += 1
     cap.release()
     ```

     ```python
     cap = cv2.VideoCapture('path_to_test_video.mp4')
     ```

2. **Inference Loop:**
   - Implement a loop to read frames, perform detection, and display results with bounding boxes.
     ```python
     while cap.isOpened():
         ret, frame = cap.read()
         if not ret:
             break
         results = yolo.predict(frame)
         annotated_frame = results.render()  # Draw bounding boxes
         cv2.imshow('Real-Time Detection', annotated_frame)
         if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
             break
     cap.release()
     cv2.destroyAllWindows()
     ```

3. **Optimization for Speed:**
   - Reduce image resolution if necessary.
   - Batch frames if possible.
   - Utilize model quantization (e.g., FP16) to speed up inference.

4. **Memory Management:**
   - Ensure that the pipeline efficiently handles memory to stay within limits.
   - Release unused variables and use in-place operations where possible.

### Hour 20-21: Evaluation and Optimization

**Objective:** Assess the model’s performance based on speed, accuracy, and memory, and optimize accordingly.

**Steps:**

1. **Speed Measurement:**
   - Time the inference process to measure milliseconds per frame.
     ```python
     import time
     start_time = time.time()
     # Perform inference
     end_time = time.time()
     inference_time = end_time - start_time
     ```

2. **Accuracy Assessment:**
   - Use the provided evaluation metrics to compute precision, recall, F1-score, and mAP.
   - Utilize validation set predictions to calculate the metrics.

3. **Memory Profiling:**
   - Monitor GPU and CPU memory usage during inference.
     ```python
     import torch
     print(torch.cuda.memory_summary())
     ```

4. **Optimization Techniques:**
   - **Model Pruning:** Remove less significant neurons or layers.
   - **Quantization:** Convert model weights to lower precision (e.g., INT8).
   - **TensorRT Optimization:** If applicable, use TensorRT for further speed improvements.
   - **Batch Processing:** Optimize batch sizes for better GPU utilization.

5. **Iterative Improvement:**
   - Make adjustments based on evaluation results and re-train or fine-tune as necessary.
